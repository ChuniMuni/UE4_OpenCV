# About
This repository contains a simple example of how to use the OpenCV machine vision library in the UnrealEngine4
video game editor, allowing you add machine vision AI to your video games.  The example uses the stock SideScroller
game template with a a simple edge-detection algorithm, but can easily be
adapted to use other algorithms from OpenCV.

# Prerequisites

## Hardware

Check [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/GettingStarted/RecommendedSpecifications/)
for the minimum hardware recommended by Unreal Engine.

## Toolchain

You will need Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). We are attempting to use the latest version, which as of the time of this
writing is UE4.18.2.  

Windows users will need Visual Studio Community (we're using the latest version, 2017).
If you don't have UE4 or Visual Studio 2017 installed, these
[instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/#visualstudio2017users) 
will help get you started. If you've already been using C++ to develop video games with
older versions of these tools (Visual Studio 2015, UE 4.16), we recommend sticking with those, as we've found that
the differences between Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 can cause problems for UE4 if you're not careful (inability
to generate a .sln file from a .uproject file, inability to compile source code, etc.).

Linux users should follow these [instructions](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Building\_On\_Linux).  If (like us) you like
to build your projects from the bash command line, follow these
[instructions](https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/c-gameplay-programming/97022-linux-how-to-compile-c-scripts-from-terminal) to add a bash-shell command allowing you to do this.

# Build

You should first clone the UE4_OpencCV repository into your <b>Documents/Unreal Projects</b> folder, creating
that folder if it doesn't already exist.

Navigate to the UE4_OpenCV folder, right-click on

<b>OpenCV.uproject</b>, and select the menu item <b>Generate Visual Studio project files</b>.  This
should create a file <b>UE4_OpenCV.sln</b> and some new folders.
If you don't get the new .sln file, it's probably because UE4 cannot find a C++ compiler for
the version of Visual Studio you've installed (see discussion 
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/#beforesetting-upyourue4-to-vsworkflow)).  Double-clicking on the .sln file should launch Visual Studio.  The first time you
launch Visual Studio, it can take several minutes to parse up all the C++ source
code for the UE4 engine.  

Once Visual Studio is done parsing the UE4 source code, do <b>Build / Build Solution</b>.  This will create
a <b>Binaries</b> folder.  Navigate to <b>ThirdParty/OpenCV/Libraries/Win64</b>, and copy/paste the 
file <b>opencv_world340.dll</b> to the new <b>Binaries</b> folder.  Finally, hit the <b>F5</b> key to launch
launch the UE4 editor, and press the Play button. In the upper-left of the display you should see a little 
camera view from the character's perspective, along with a report of the frame rate (FPS).

# How it works

The starting point for this project was the C++ code generated by the simple SideScroller example provided by 
UnrealEngine4.  Using the UnrealEditor, I created a Blueprint from the SideScrollerCPP character.
Then, based on this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adYVI5XYmoI) I
used UnrealEditor to add a camera to the SideScroller character Blueprint, added a ScreenCaptureComponent2D
to the camera, and set the TextureTarget of the ScreenCaptureComponent2D to a TextureRenderTarget2D (referred to
as <b>T_Minimap</b> in the video).  Instead of adding a HUD as a Blueprint in UnrealEditor, I created
a [VisionHUD](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.h) class in C++, whose
constructor [loads](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp#L16-L20)
the TextureRenderTarget2D object from the Blueprint and uses it to
[create](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp#L22-L30) an FRenderTarget object.  The VisionHUD's DrawHUD method
[reads](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp#L53-L54) the RGBA pixel values from the FRenderTarget,
[stores](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp#L65-L67) the R, G, and B components into an ordinary
byte array, and [passes](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp#L81-82) byte array to the OpenCV-based
machine-vision algorithm.

# Modifying / Extending

To add a machine-vision HUD like this to another UE4 C++ project, you should use the following files:

* [SideScroller.Build.cs](Source/SideScrollerCPP/SideScrollerCPP.Build.cs) As described in this 
[tutorial](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Detailed_Account_Of_Integrating_OpenCV_Into_UE4_With_VS2017),
the contents (public and private methods) of this class can be copy/pasted into the .Build.cs class for your
project.

* [EdgeDetection.h](Source/SideScrollerCPP/EdgeDetection.h) / 
[EdgeDetection.cpp](Source/SideScrollerCPP/EdgeDetection.cpp) Modify and/or rename this class to run the
OpenCV algorithm(s) of your choice.

* [OnscreenDebug.h](Source/SideScrollerCPP/OnscreenDebug.h) / 
[OnscreenDebug.cpp](Source/SideScrollerCPP/OnscreenDebug.cpp) This class has nothing to do with machine vision; instead,
it's provides a simple way to add onscreen debugging printout to your UE4 projects.  In this project, I'm 
[using](Source/SideScrollerCPP/SideScrollerCPPCharacter.cpp#L65-L70)  it to display the frame rate.

* [VisionAlgorithm.h](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionAlgorithm.h) Subclass this class to run your machine-vision 
algorithm.

* [VisionHUD.h](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.h) / 
[VisionHUD.cpp](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp) This code requires almost no modification to support a new
vision algorithm.  All you need to do is change the <b>#include</b> at the 
[top](Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp#L13-L14) of the implementation, and the class constructor that
you [invoke]((Source/SideScrollerCPP/VisionHUD.cpp#L37-L38).
